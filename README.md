# smart-waste-management-system-using-IOT

One of the main concerns with environment is solid waste management which impacts the health and environment of the society. Smart dustbin is designed in such a way that the dustbin is attached with sensor, to detect the level of waste. On reaching up the certain level, the notification message is sent to the concerned persons. If the concerned person doesnâ€™t respond even after the receiving of message and if the level of the waste exceeds certain threshold then the message will be sent to the higher officials to send the concerned persons to clean. When a person comes to throw the dust in the bin that has already reached certain limit then a buzzer sound is made not to throw the dust in that particular bin and use the other . We use Arduino and thinkspeak software to store the data .The information from the bin to the authorized number is sent using communicating modules (GSM module). This project is useful for the municipality services and to keep surroundings tidy which saves the environment.
